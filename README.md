# Bhanu Mehar – Internship Onboarding Repository

This repository contains my **internship onboarding work**, technical practice tasks, and learning milestones completed as part of the **Focus Bear internship program**.

The purpose of this repository is to:
- Practice real-world development workflows
- Build strong foundations in Git, terminal usage, and Swift
- Document learning clearly through code, commits, and reflections
- Demonstrate progress over time through structured tasks and issues

This repository will continue to grow as I complete the remaining onboarding issues.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organised by topic so that each task is easy to locate and review.

14 directories, 10 files

```

Each folder represents a **specific learning area or task group**.  
Reflections are written in Markdown to clearly explain what was learned and why.

## What I Have Practiced So Far

So far, this repository includes work on:

- Git fundamentals (commit history, branches, cherry-pick, conflicts)
- Terminal navigation and shell commands
- Custom `.zshrc` aliases and functions
- Error handling and guard clauses in Swift
- Clean code principles with before/after refactoring
- Writing clear technical reflections in Markdown
- Proper commit messages and push workflow

Each completed task includes:
- Actual working code
- Terminal execution and verification
- Reflections explaining decisions and outcomes

---

## How This Repository Is Used

- Each onboarding issue corresponds to **one or more commits**
- Code is committed incrementally, not dumped all at once
- Reflections explain *why* something was done, not just *what*
- Screenshots are added to GitHub issues when required
- This repository acts as a **learning log**, not just a code dump

---

## Workflow Followed

- Create or switch to the appropriate branch when required
- Implement the task locally
- Verify behaviour through terminal or Swift execution
- Write reflections in Markdown
- Commit with clear, meaningful messages
- Push changes to GitHub
- Close the corresponding issue with evidence

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

- Git & GitHub
- macOS Terminal (zsh)
- Swift
- SwiftUI (for UI-related tasks)
- VS Code (editing and terminal)
- Xcode (when required for SwiftUI tasks)
- Markdown for documentation

---

## Current Status

- Internship onboarding **in progress**
- Multiple tasks completed and pushed
- Remaining onboarding issues will be added progressively
- Repository will be continuously updated

---

## Notes

This repository is intentionally structured for **learning and review**, not as a production application.  
Clarity, correctness, and understanding are prioritised over complexity.
