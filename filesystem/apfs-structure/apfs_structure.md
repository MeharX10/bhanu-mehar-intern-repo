# 5.7 – APFS Structure Basics

This task is complete. I researched the structure of **APFS (Apple File System)** and documented the core 
components, how they relate to each other, and why Apple designed APFS this way.

## What is APFS
APFS (Apple File System) is the modern file system used by Apple on macOS, iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, and tvOS.  
It is designed for **SSD-based storage**, strong data integrity, fast snapshots, and efficient space 
usage.

## Core APFS Components

### Physical Disk
- The actual hardware (SSD or flash storage)
- Can contain one or more partitions
- An APFS container lives inside a partition

---

### APFS Container
- A logical storage pool
- Holds **multiple APFS volumes**
- Uses **space sharing**, meaning volumes do not have fixed sizes
- Allows flexible growth and shrinkage of volumes

Why this matters:
Instead of pre-allocating disk space, all volumes draw from the same free pool.

---

### APFS Volumes
Each container can contain multiple volumes, commonly:

**System Volume**
- Read-only on modern macOS
- Contains the operating system files

**Data Volume**
- Read-write
- Stores user data, apps, and documents

**Preboot Volume**
- Contains files needed to boot encrypted volumes

**Recovery Volume**
- Used for recovery tools and macOS reinstall

**VM Volume**
- Used for swap files and virtual memory

---

## Key APFS Features

### Space Sharing
- Volumes dynamically share free space
- No need to resize partitions manually

### Snapshots
- Read-only, point-in-time views of a volume
- Used by Time Machine and system updates
- Very fast and storage-efficient

### Copy-on-Write
- Data is never overwritten directly
- New data is written elsewhere, then metadata is updated
- Prevents corruption during crashes or power loss

### Strong Encryption
- Native support for single-key and multi-key encryption
- Encryption is built into the file system, not layered on top

---

## Why APFS Is Better Than Older File Systems
Compared to older file systems like HFS+:

- Faster on SSDs
- Safer writes using copy-on-write
- Built-in snapshots
- Flexible volume management
- Strong encryption support

**Understanding the APFS Structure through the screenshot**

- **Physical Disk:** This is the actual SSD hardware inside the Mac.
- **APFS Container:** A container is a logical space created on the disk. It holds multiple APFS volumes 
and manages shared storage.
- **APFS Volumes:** Each volume has a specific purpose:
- **Macintosh HD:** Read-only system files for macOS.
- **Macintosh HD Data:** User files, apps, documents.
- **Preboot**: Files needed to start macOS securely.
- **VM:** Virtual memory and swap files.
- **Free space:** Unused storage shared dynamically.
- **Key APFS feature:** All volumes share the same container space, instead of having fixed sizes.

This matches Apple’s real APFS design.
